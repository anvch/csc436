# Snappy Bird 
This app is a sound-based game mimicking Flappy Bird, created for CSC 436's final project. Instead of taps, the way to get the bird to jump and avoid obstacles is sound-based (i.e. by snapping). The main motivation for this project was to utilize the microphone/sound recording features of a mobile device.

### Features + Dependencies
AudioRecord
You will need to have microphone input functionality and permissions to run this app successfully. I attempted running on the device emulator, but the sound input did not work so I tested on a physical device.

### Extra!
I included a bird icon to make the UI seem a little less sad (circle previously).. also, this game runs both horizontally and vertically (although much harder when horizontal).
